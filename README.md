# FACE-MASK-DETECTION
In this project i will be building deep learning model to identify if a person is using face mask or not. I used deep learning models like MobileNetV2 and trained it using different parameters and tested it using an image and also by using live video in webcam. 


With LEARNING_RATE = 1e-4
epoch = 1
batch_size = 32 i acheived an accuracy of 98.83
